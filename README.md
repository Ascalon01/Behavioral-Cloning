# Behavioral Cloning Project

Project Overview
---
This project, uses concepts of deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to clone driving behavior. We will train, validate and test a model using Keras. The model will output a steering angle to an autonomous vehicle.

The goal of this project is ,
* Use the simulator to collect data of good driving behavior.
* Build, a convolution neural network in [Keras](https://keras.io/) that predicts steering angles from images.
* Train and validate the model with a training and validation set.
* Test that the model successfully drives around track one without leaving the road.

Files in the repository

* [model.py](./model.py) is the script to create and train the model.
* [drive.py](./drive.py) is the script For driving the car in autonomous mode in the simulator.
* [video.py](./video.py) is the script for generating video from the images obtained after driving car in autonomous mode.
* [model.h5](./model.h5) is the trained convolution neural network.
* [writeup](./writeup.md) detailing the results of the project and describing the procedure for Behavioral Cloning.
